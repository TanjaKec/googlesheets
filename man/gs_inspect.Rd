a ggplot object

\description{
\emph{This function is still experimental. Expect it to change! Or
disappear?} This function plots a data.frame and gives a sense of what sort
of data is where (e.g. character vs. numeric vs factor). Empty cells (ie.
\code{NA}'s) are also indicated. The purpose is to get oriented to sheets
that contain more than one data rectangle. Right now, due to the tabular,
data-frame nature of the input, we aren't really conveying when disparate
data types appear in a column. That might be something to work on in a future
version, if this proves useful. That would require working with cell-by-cell
data, i.e. from the cell feed.
